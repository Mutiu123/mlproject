# End to End Student Graduation Success Predictive Model using MLOPs Approach


**Project Overview:**

In this project, I develop an end-to-end machine learning system that predicts student
graduation outcomes. The model can analyse various student features to identify those at risk
of not graduating, enabling early intervention. l employed MLOps practices to ensure the
model is scalable, maintainable, and continuously improved. This project topic is designed to
impact educational institutions meaningfully by leveraging predictive analytics to support
student success. It also provides a comprehensive experience in applying MLOps practices to
a real-world problem.

**Key Components:**

	**Data Collection and Management:**

	• Compile a dataset with student demographics, academic performance, and other relevant features.

	• Use Data Version Control (DVC) to track and manage data versions.

	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

	• Perform EDA to understand patterns and relationships in the data.
	• Visualize key insights that could influence model predictions.

	**Feature Engineering and Selection:**
	• Engineer new features that could improve model performance.

	• Select the most predictive features using techniques like feature importance.

	**Model Training and Evaluation:**
	• Train various classification models to predict graduation likelihood.

	• Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

	**MLOps Pipeline Integration:**

	• Integrate the model into an MLOps pipeline for automated testing, integration, and deployment.

	• Use tools like GitHub Actions and CI/CD for automation.

	**Model Deployment and Monitoring:**

	• Deploy the model as a service using cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.

	• Monitor the model’s performance in production using MLflow or Prometheus.

	**Feedback Loop for Continuous Learning:**

	• Implement a feedback mechanism to collect new data and retrain the model periodically.

	• Ensure the model adapts to changes in student demographics or academic policies.

	**User Interface for Stakeholders:**

	• Develop a user-friendly interface for educators to input data and receive predictions.

	• Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on model outputs.
