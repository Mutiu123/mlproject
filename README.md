# End to End Student Graduation Success Predictive Model using MLOPs Approach


**Project Overview:**

In this project, I develop an end-to-end machine learning system that predicts student
graduation outcomes. The model can analyse various student features to identify those at risk
of not graduating, enabling early intervention. l employed MLOps practices to ensure the
model is scalable, maintainable, and continuously improved. This project topic is designed to
impact educational institutions meaningfully by leveraging predictive analytics to support
student success. It also provides a comprehensive experience in applying MLOps practices to
a real-world problem.
